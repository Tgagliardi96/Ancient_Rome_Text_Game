# Ancient_Rome_Text_Game
How was the preparation of a war campaign during the Ancient Rome Empire? Find out playing this simple text adventure game!

This project was elaborated on Python with the specific objective of introducing in an original way a campaign of war in the Ancient Rome. With the simple passages that
compose the game everyone can explore one of most important and historical empires. The game was thought to be approachable from anyone requiring simple strategic choices, 
and, most importantly, the desire to have fun.

Project Description

The game is an interactive text adventure based on questions made by the game and inputs the player has to make to arrive at the final stage.
It was elaborated on Python during my very first coding course at Hult Business School. The two sources used have been 'Python for Business Analytics' and 
'Learn Python the Hard Way'. Even though both resources have been foundamental to think about the project, starting and finishing it, it has also been hard to complete
this work. 
The techniques utilized aren't very sophisticated and comprehend if statements, format-strings, inputs, random choices connected to loops. In order to have an acceptable
graphic view were also utilized escape sequences to order the strings and make easier for the player to approach the game.

Table of Contents.

The game is structured in five stages.
1. Senate Call: the player has to decide if accepting the request that is made.
2. Mission Preparation: the second decision comes in. The player has to decide in which territory will fight.
3. Army: the strategy is brought into the game. Given the characteristics of each territory the player has to decide which troops will compose the army.
4. Gods: a deep introduction into the culture of Rome. The player will have to make a choice between the divinities of the Empire.
5. Speech: the conclusion is related to a famous movie. The player will have to complete one of the most famous quotes of the cinema.
